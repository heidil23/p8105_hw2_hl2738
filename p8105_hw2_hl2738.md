## Problem 1

#### Set up the Mr. Trash Wheel data set

Here we will read in the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel sheet and clean the data.

``` r
trash_wheel_df =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

#### Set up the precipitation data set

Next we will read in and clean the precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.
Then we will combine the 2018 and 2019 precpitation data sets into a new
data frame.

``` r
precipitation_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%
  rename("2018" = total)

precipitation_2019 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%
  rename("2019" = total)

precipitation_df =
  left_join(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

#### Summarize the Mr. Trash Wheel and Precipitation data sets

Mr. Trash Wheel is a “water-wheel vessel that removes trash from the
Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.” The Mr. Trash Wheel data set
contains information on 344 dumpsters, with litter collected between
2014 and 2019. There was a total of 1122.45 tons of litter, with a
volume of 5347 cubic yards, removed during this time. The type of litter
collected included 644365 plastic bottles, 735707 foam containers, 8724
glass bottles, 451062 grocery bags, 612414 chip bags, and 4055 sports
balls. The median number of sports balls collected each year was 6 in
2014, 16 in 2015, 26 in 2016, 8 in 2017, 4 in 2018, and 8.5 in 2019.
