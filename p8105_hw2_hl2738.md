## Problem 1

#### Set up the Mr. Trash Wheel data set

Here we will read in the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel sheet and clean the data.

``` r
trash_wheel_df =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

#### Set up the precipitation data set

Next we will read in and clean the precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.
Then we will combine the 2018 and 2019 precpitation data sets into a new
data frame.

``` r
precipitation_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%
  rename("2018" = total)

precipitation_2019 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%
  rename("2019" = total)

precipitation_df =
  left_join(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

#### Summarize the Mr. Trash Wheel data set

Mr. Trash Wheel is a “water-wheel vessel that removes trash from the
Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.” The Mr. Trash Wheel data set
contains information on 344 dumpsters, with litter collected between
2014 and 2019. There was a total of 1122.45 tons of litter, with a
volume of 5347 cubic yards, removed during this time. The type of litter
collected included 644365 plastic bottles, 735707 foam containers, 8724
glass bottles, 451062 grocery bags, 612414 chip bags, and 4055 sports
balls. The median number of sports balls collected each year was 6 in
2014, 16 in 2015, 26 in 2016, 8 in 2017, 4 in 2018, and 8.5 in 2019.

#### Summarize the precipitation data set

The precipitation dataset summarizes the precipitation during 12 months
in 2018 and 2019. The total precipitation in between January and
December 2018 was 70.33 inches. The median monthly precipitation was
5.455 inches. The maximum monthly precipitation in 2018 was 10.47 inches
and occurred during the month of September. For 2019, precipitation data
is available only between January and June. The total precipitation in
2019 was 16.67 inches. The median monthly precipitation was 3.34 and the
maximum monthly precipitation was 4.47 inches and occurred in March.

## Problem 2

#### Import and clean the pols-month file

First, we will import and clean the data in pols-month.csv. Below is the
code to convert the variable “mon” to separate “day,” “month,” and
“year” variables. In addition, the code below creates a new variable
“president” with levels “gop” and “dem,” and then removes the prez\_dem,
prez\_gop, and day variables.

``` r
pols_df = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon,
           c("year", "month", "day"),
           sep = "([-])",
           convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_dem == "1", "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, president)
```

#### Import and clean the snp file

Next we will import and clean the data in the snp.csv file.

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date,
           c("month", "day", "year"),
           sep = "([/])",
           convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  relocate(year, month)
```

#### Import and clean the unmployment file

Next we will import and clean the data in the unemployment file.

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent"
  )
```
